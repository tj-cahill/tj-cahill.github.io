I was born and raised in Calgary, Canada and developed an interest in computers at a young age. Growing up, I spent weekends and summers taking programming classes and reading books on software development. I eventually narrowed my focus to how humans use computers to tell stories, create fictional worlds, and share emotional experiences.

I completed my undergraduate education at Emerson College in Boston, receiving a BFA in Writing & Literature and a B.Sc. in Political Communication with honors. Pursuing my passion for understanding digital media in a social context, I received an MA in Emerging Media Studies from Boston University and am currently working on completing my PhD.

When I am not researching or teaching, I can either be found hiking, snowshoeing, or kayaking in the Great Outdoors, or playing video games, constructing virtual experiences, or writing and performing poetry in a basement somewhere.
