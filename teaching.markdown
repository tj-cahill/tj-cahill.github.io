My approach to teaching is workshop-based and heavily collaborative. Whether I am helping my students to express themselves through speech or to understand and apply principles of robust social-scientific research, I strive to treat them as independent learners, to enable them to set and meet their own goals, and to work with them to adapt the classroom environment to their needs.

In the past, I have taught or assisted with college-level courses on the following subjects:

- Advanced text analysis [graduate-level]
- Web development [graduate-level]
- Media psychology [graduate-level]
- Emerging media and society
- Communication theory
- Professional communication
- Journalism
