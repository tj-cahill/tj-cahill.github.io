My research focuses on understanding how users process immersive environments and interactive narratives on cognitive and emotional levels. I conduct psychological experiments in the Communication Research Center using video games and virtual reality technology. In the past, I have drawn from both commercially-available and custom-designed entertainment software to form the basis of the stimuli I use.

I also conduct research on online harassment and cyberbullying, particularly within online communities and subcultures, with the aim of making gaming culture less toxic while also promoting a free exchange of ideas.
